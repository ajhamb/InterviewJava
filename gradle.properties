## Gradle JVM configuration
##
## If Gradle fails because it "requires JVM 17 or later to run" you can point Gradle at a newer JDK
## by setting `org.gradle.java.home` to the JDK installation path on your machine.
##
## Example (Temurin 21 installed via Homebrew Cask):
## org.gradle.java.home=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/temurin-21.jdk/Contents/Home
##
## Uncomment and edit the line above to match your local JDK installation if you can't or don't want
## to change your system `JAVA_HOME` or shell profile.

# org.gradle.java.home=
